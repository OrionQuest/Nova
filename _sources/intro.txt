Introduction to the Nova Library
================================

Welcome to Nova, a multi-physics computational library that provides support for
simulation, rendering and visualization. Nova is written primarily in C++ and supports all
the latest open-source libraries and file formats for handling different kinds
of data sets such as meshes, images, or volumes. Its unique design features a modular
architecture for ease of use in geometric modeling and simulation, along with a plug-in
based infrastructure that allows easy visualization of custom data structures.
The library supports cross-platform compilation and has been extensively
optimized using SSE and AVX vector instructions as well as OpenMP
parallelization. It provides support for simulating multi-body dynamics,
compressible and incompressible fluids, and volumetric elastic objects based on
the research work of its co-authors over the past several years.
