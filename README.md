# Nova [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OrionQuest/Nova.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OrionQuest/Nova)

Nova is a high-performance library for computational physics, providing support
for fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, and two-way coupled interactions. It uses
novel geometric data structures and algorithms for high fidelity simulations that
have been designed by its co-authors over the years.
